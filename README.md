# -INTELLIGENT-TRANSPORTATION-SYSTEM-WITH-AUTONOMOUS-DRIVING-SCHEMES-FOR-TRAFFIC-CONTROL-
Simulink model to control the yaw and pose of automated vehicles based on the environment at a signalized intersection.


**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**
The main aim of our project is to simulate an intelligent transportation system in traffic intersection. In our project we will design and analyse the decision logic for negotiating a traffic light. The decision logic in this project reacts to the state of the traffic light, distance to the traffic light, and distance to the closest vehicle ahead. We can use this system to understand the interaction between decision logic and controller at a traffic intersection. We will also develop a test bench with subsystems such as Sensors & environment, Traffic light decision, Lane follow control, Vehicle dynamic and Visualization with MATLAB, SIMULINK and SIMEVENTS. By modifying the test bench, a little we can test different scenarios for future works.
